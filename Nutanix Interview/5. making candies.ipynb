    "Karl loves playing games on social networking sites. His current favorite is CandyMaker, where the goal is to make candies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Karl just started a level in which he must accumulate 'n' candies starting with 'm' machines and w workers. In a single pass, he can make m*w candies. After each pass, he can decide whether to spend some of his candies to buy more machines or hire more workers. Buying a machine or hiring a worker costs 'p' units, and there is no limit to the number of machines he can own or workers he can employ.\n",
    "\n",
    "Karl wants to minimize the number of passes to obtain the required number of candies at the end of a day. Determine that number of passes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, Karl starts with m=1 machine and w=2 workers. The cost to purchase or hire, p=1 and he needs to accumulate 60 candies. He executes the following strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Make m*w = 1*2 = 2 candies. Purchase two machines.\n",
    "  2. Make 3*2 = 6 candies. Purchase 3 machines and hire 2 workers.\n",
    "  3. Make 6*5 = 30 candies. Retain all 30 candies.\n",
    "  4. Make 6*5 = 30 candies. With yesterday's production, Karl has 60 candies.\n",

    "**Function Description**\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the minimumPasses function in the editor below. The function must return a long integer representing the minimum number of passes required.\n",
    "\n",
    "minimumPasses has the following parameter(s):\n",
    "\n",
    "    m: long integer, the starting number of machines\n",
    "    w: long integer, the starting number of workers\n",
    "    p: long integer, the cost of a new hire or a new machine\n",
    "    n: long integer, the number of candies to produce\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "**Here are some hints and observations that should help solve this problem:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    There are two strategies, \"invest\" and \"save\". \"Invest\" means we're buying as many machines/workers as possible as soon as we can, \"save\" means we just keep accumulating candies every turn without investing.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    For a single round of investing, it is optimal to make purchases such that after the purchase, the number of machines is as close to the number of workers as possible. Example: 5*5 > 4*6 > 3*7 etc.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The optimal overall strategy will consist of an investing phase at the beginning, and at some point to stop investing and transition into a saving phase. It is not obvious where this crossover point is. It should be obvious that going back and forth between saving and investing is never optimal. Less obvious is that if we're investing, we're investing as much as possible in a single round. I haven't been able to construct an example where it is better to partially invest and save in a single round, but haven't worked out a formal proof.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In the \"invest\" phase, the candy production will grow exponentially, which means iterating over all turns where we can invest should be efficient enough. This will require to \"skip\" turns where we can't invest, if p is a large value. This can be done with simple arithmetic in constant time.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    After every investment, we can calculate how many turns already elapsed plus how many turns of saving it will take to reach our goal. We keep a running minimum of this number, and this will be the end result. Since this number can be calculated arithmetically in constant time, our algorithm will run in logarithmic time (or in fractional power power time, haven't exactly figured this out).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    We can terminate when we have accumulated enough machines/workers to produce >= n candies in one turn, and return the running minimum we determined above."
