Consider the following relation and determinants.

R(a, b,c,d)

                   a,c -> b,d
                   a,d -> b
        Also, a,b is a primary key for the above relation.
The above relation is in x NF form where x may take the following values {1,2,3,3.5} corresponding to {1NF, 2NF, 3NF and BCNF} respectively.
What is the maximum possible value of x such that the above relation satisfies the *x*NF form?
Your answer should only be restricted to one of these numbers:1/2/3/3.5 Do not leave any leading or trailing spaces.


-> 3nf. 

For R to be in BCNF, in all functional dependencies (X->Y), determinant must be a candidate key, i.e. X must be a candidate key (or, simply a key. Caution: It can not be a superkey, it must be a candidate key).

Now, in the question, there are three FDs (functional dependencies). Let's list them down: 1. ab -> cd 2. ac -> bd 3. ad -> b

In (1), ab is primary key (given) so it is a candidate key. So, (1) satisfies BCNF. In (2), ac can uniquely determine all of the rest of attributes, i.e. bd. So, it must be a candidate key as well. Therefore, (2) satisfies BCNF. In (3), ad is not a candidate key, because it does not uniquely determine rest of the attributes (it determines only b).

So, in (3) ad is not a candidate key, therefore BCNF is not satisfied.

Note, that R is in 3NF. 3NF holds if for every FD:X->A in the relation - (i) X is a superkey of R, or (ii) A is a prime attribute of R So, in (1) ab is the superkey, in (2) ac is the superkey, and in (3) b is a prime attribute (i.e. b is a subset of a candidate key). 
So, R is in 3NF.
