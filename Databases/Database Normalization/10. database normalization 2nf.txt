A particular database is normalized to satisfy a particular level of normalization (either 1NF or 2NF or 3NF). One of the tables contains, among other fields, a column 

for the City and a column for the Zip Code. Assuming that there is a many-to-one mapping between the set of Zip Code(s) and City, we may conclude that the database is 

definitely NOT in xxNF form. What is the integer x (1, 2, or 3)? Fill your answer in the  text box below.

->3 because 2nf supportsmany - 1 relationshp
