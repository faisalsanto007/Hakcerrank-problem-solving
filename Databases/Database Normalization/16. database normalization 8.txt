Let us take the example of a simple movie library. Each movie has a description, director, and serial number. 
Customers have a name, address, and membership number. Assume only one copy of each movie exists in the library. 
We are given the following relations and determinants. The keys for each relation are CAPITALIZED.

Relations (The key is CAPITALIZED):
customer(name,addr,MEMBERNO)
movie(DESCRIPTION,director,serialno)
borrow(memberno,DATE,SERIALNO)

Which of these determinants is a NON-KEY dependency? In the text box, only enter the index number (1-6) of the 
dependency which you have identified as non-key.

1.  description->director,serialno
2.  serialno->description
3.  serialno->director
4.  name,addr -> memberno
5.  memberno -> name,addr
6.  serialno,date -> memberno

-> 3. the table to find the non-key dependency

description->director,serialno
serialno->description
serialno->director
name,addr -> memberno
memberno -> name,addr
serialno,date -> memberno

each index value has a relation between them thus the index value 3 has serial no which is not a key dependency.
