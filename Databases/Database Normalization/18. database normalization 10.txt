The following table stores rows of information about pizza deliveries. The three columns correspond to the 
Restaurant name, Crust, Delivery Area. We convert this table into Fourth Normal Form and so we end up creating 
two tables, each with two columns and N rows. (Both the new tables have an equal number of rows)

Restaurant  Crust       Delivery Area
-------------------------------------------
X Pizza     Thick       Whitefield
X Pizza     Thick       Greenville
X Pizza     Thick       Capital
X Pizza     Stuffed     Whitefield
X Pizza     Stuffed     Greenville
X Pizza     Stuffed     Capital
Papa Pizza  Thin        Capital
Papa Pizza  Stuffed     Capital
F1 Pizza    Thick       Whitefield
F1 Pizza    Thick       Greenville
F1 Pizza    Thin        Whitefield
F1 Pizza    Thin        Greenville

In the text box below, enter the value of the integer N.


-> 6. A table is in 4NF if and only if, for every one of its non-trivial multivalued 
dependencies X {\displaystyle \twoheadrightarrow } \twoheadrightarrow Y, X is a superkey—that is, X is either 
a candidate key or a superset thereof"

The tables after normalization would be:

Restaurant | Crust
X Pizza                       |Thick   
X Pizza                       |Stuffed 
Papa Pizza                |Thin    
Papa Pizza                |Stuffed 
F1 Pizza                     |Thick   
F1 Pizza                     |Thin   
 
Restaurant | Delivery Area
X Pizza                         |Whitefield
X Pizza                         |Greenville
X Pizza                         |Capital
Papa Pizza                  |Capital
F1 Pizza                       |Whitefield
F1 Pizza                       |Greenville

So the answer is 6
