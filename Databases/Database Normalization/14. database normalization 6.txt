Let us take the example of a simple movie library. Each movie has a description, director, and serial number. 
Customers have a name, address, and membership number. Assume only one copy of each movie exists in the library. 
We are given the following relations and determinants. The keys for each relation are CAPITALIZED.

    Relations (The key is CAPITALIZED):
    customer(name,addr,MEMBERNO)
    movie(DESCRIPTION,director,serialno)
    borrow(memberno,DATE,SERIALNO)

    Determinants:
    description->director,serialno
    serialno->description
    serialno->director
    name,addr -> memberno
    memberno -> name,addr
    serialno,date -> memberno

The above relation is in x**NF form where x may take the following values {1,2,3,3.5} corresponding to {1NF, 2NF, 3NF and BCNF} respectively.
What is the maximum possible value of **x such that the above relation satisfies the *x*NF form?
Your answer should only be restricted to one of these numbers:1/2/3/3.5 Do not leave any leading or trailing spaces.


-> 2nf. 
The requirement for 2NF is that it is in 1NF (essentially, everything is atomic - there are not multiple entries on a 
column, nor repeating columns, such as customer1, customer2, customer 3) PLUS all non-key values are dependant on 
primary key/s (within the context of the relationships within the tables, not necessarily in real life). 
The list of determinants shows that this is the case, so it meets this bar.

The requirement for 3NF is that there is no TRANSITIVE DEPENDENCE (a column does not rely on the value of another 
column through an intermediary column). The issue is with the column movie. The "director" is dependent on "serialno", 
which itself is dependent on "description" (A->B + B->C = A->C). So there is a transitive dependence here.
