Consider the following relation and determinants. The key(s) are bolded.
R(a, b ,c,d,e)

Which of these determinants is a NON-CANDIDATE key? In the text box, only enter the index number (1-3) of the 
dependency which you have identified as non-key.

1. a,c -> b,d,e
2. a,d -> b
3. a,c,e -> b,d

-> 2.  a and b are the keys, as b is on RHS in all 3, so we can't consider it. Now in first FD, with c, a can 
determines remaining b, d and e. In third dependency, with c and e, a can determine remaining b and d. 
But in second FD, with d, a can only determine b, so there's uncertainity for remaining c and e. 
So that is why number 2's determinants a and d can't(only) make(be) candidate key, so that is a non candidate key.

another answer, 2 - A canidate key is a subset of a superkey (hence, why it is also called a "minimal superkey"). 
A superkey is capable of uniquely identifying all rows. #2 is the only one that doesn't list all of the attributes. 
Hence, it can't be a superkey.
