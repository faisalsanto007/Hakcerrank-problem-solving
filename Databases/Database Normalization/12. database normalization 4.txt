A database, normalized as per 2NF rules, has been split into 10 tables. 
Each of the tables has exactly two columns: one key attribute and one non-key attribute. 
What is the minimum number of tables required to express this database in 3NF form? 
Enter the integer in the text box below. Do not leave any leading or trailing spaces.

-> 10, it cannot be simplified because there is two different attribute in each table and according to the rule of 3NF,
it cannot be simplified enough. 
To be 3NF it must be in 2NF and have no transitive dependency (a functional dependency between 2 or more non key 
attributes), hence it cant be further simplified as they are already in tables where there is a nonkey and key attribute.
